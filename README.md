# analysis_empty_scanpy_rpy2

This notebook is designed to be initiated together with the *Extended Scanpy environment (Python + R support)* based on the docker image [fastgenomics/jupyter-lt2019](https://hub.docker.com/r/fastgenomics/jupyter-lt2019), which is a reproduction of the image used in the [single-cell-tutorial](https://github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial) by LÃ¼cken & Theis (2019).

## Content

Additionally to `fgread`, the notebook imports several packages to give the user an idea what is possible with this environment. Most importantly, the `rpy2` package is imported and the user is notified that it is possible to use R functionality.
